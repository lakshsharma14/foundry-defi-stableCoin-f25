 
 A decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to maintain **relative price stability ($1.00 peg)** using crypto collateral.  

  Stability Mechanism: Relative Stability

- **Anchored / Pegged** → $1.00  
- **Chainlink Price Feeds** → Used to fetch reliable ETH & BTC prices  
- **Collateral Exchange Function** → Allows swapping ETH & BTC for stablecoins  

  Minting & Stability

- **Algorithmic & Decentralized Minting**  
- Users can **mint stablecoins only with sufficient collateral**  
- Overcollateralization ensures price stability  

  Collateral Types (Exogenous Crypto)

- **wETH (Wrapped ETH)**  
- **wBTC (Wrapped BTC)**  

  How It Works?

1. Users deposit wETH or wBTC as collateral  
2. The protocol checks price via **Chainlink feeds**  
3. Stablecoins are minted against the deposited collateral  
4. Ensures the peg stays close to **$1.00**
